# Udacity FEWD Course - Cat Clicker App Exercise :cat2:


This exercise is presented in lesson one (Changing Expectations) of the Front-End Applications section of the course. There are a number of requirements for the exercise which are changed as the lesson progresses.

Further requirements are specified from lesson eight, to build the premium version of this exercise.

## Requirements
The current requirements as this exercise is being developed are:-

### Visuals
The application should display:
- [ ] A list of at least five cats, listed by name.
- [ ] An area to display the selected cat.
In the cat display area, the following should be displayed:
- [ ] the cat's name.
- [ ] a picture of the cat.
- [ ] text showing the number of clicks.

Styling is not specified so is left to the developer.

### Interactivity
- [ ] When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
- [ ] The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.

### Extras
For learning purposes and to keep my hand in after completing the JS testing modules, Jasmine BDD approach will be used to develop this exercise.

The version used for this exercise is Jasmine 3.1.0.
